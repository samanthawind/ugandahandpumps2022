## ATTACHED FILES
### Wind2022-Reliability_of_Handpump_Functionality_Tests.R
This R script was used to calculate the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the pump capacity, ten-minute leakage rate, and flow rate tests and perform other statistical analyses using the ds01, ds02, and ds03 datasets described below.

### ds01.csv
This dataset includes the pump capacity, ten-minute leakage rate, and flow rate results from the first round of data collection, the raw data used to calculate these values, and water quality measurements (conductivity & turbidity) for each handpump tested during Round 1.

### ds02.csv
This dataset includes the pump capacity, ten-minute leakage rate, and flow rate results from the second round of data collection, the raw data used to calculate these values, and water quality measurements (conductivity & turbidity) for each handpump tested during Round 2.

### ds03.csv
This dataset includes information on the physical characteristics of each handpump and their installation and rehabilitation history.
